		"name": "Normal Attack: Spear of the Church",
		"info": "**Normal Attack**\nPerforms up to five consecutive spear strikes.\n\n**Charged Attack**\nConsumes a certain amount of Stamina to lunge forward, dealing damage to opponents along the way.\n\n**Plunging Attack**\nPlunges from mid-air to strike the ground below, damaging opponents along the path and dealing AoE DMG upon impact."

	"combat2": {
		"name": "Ravaging Confession",
		"info": "Rosaria swiftly shifts her position to appear behind her opponent, then stabs and slashes them with her polearm, dealing Cryo DMG.\nThis ability cannot be used to travel behind opponents of a larger build.",
		"description": "Those who confess to Sister Rosaria will be granted no absolution. All sinners shall be met with the piercing cold of punishment proportionate to the weight of their sins."

	"combat3": {
		"name": "Rites of Termination",
		"info": "Rosaria's unique take on this prayer ritual: First, she swings her weapon to slash surrounding opponents; then, she summons a frigid Ice Lance that strikes the ground. Both actions deal Cryo DMG.\nWhile active, the Ice Lance periodically releases a blast of cold air, dealing Cryo DMG to surrounding opponents.",
		"description": "Judgment is such a tedious ordeal — much easier to skip that phase and get straight to the last rites. Rosaria was never very devoted to the Anemo God anyway, which makes performing them all too easy."
