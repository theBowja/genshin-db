What say you?\"\n\nThe first Fatuus gave power to a young woman in whom the flame of life had all but died,\nAnd in her wild imagination, she saw the line that lay between the corrupt past and a stainless future...\n\n\"I understand. Then, let glacial ice take the place of my erased past and extinguish these undying flames.\"\n\"Let the darkness of corruption, the pain of the world, and the humans, beasts, and the sin they carry all be purified by silent ice.\"\n\nBut despite this, a pure white flame continued to burn within her heart...\n\n\"We share the same goal, you, your Tsaritsa, and I.\"\n\"Cleanse the sources of distortion in this world: short-sighted, ignorant gods and the darkness and corruption of the Abyss.\"\n\"Good. I will do whatever it takes to become an effective instrument in the advancement of our common cause.\"\n\"For even if I dress in pure white from head to toe, the ashes of the dead that have long left their stain on every inch of my being can never be cleansed.\""

One needs an environment conducive to research.\n\nFollowing a trail of rumors of heresy, the first of the Fatui tracked him down...\n\n\"Merely an enhanced human?
