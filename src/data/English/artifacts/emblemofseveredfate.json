Well, if you wish to abandon your past, allow me to give you a new name.\"\nAfter hearing about his past, the girl who possessed jet black wings sneered disdainfully.\n\"Well, you shall be called Iwakura. 'The seat of rock.' A name that human words cannot harm.\"\n\"Come on, mortal in whose veins runs the blood of the oni, be glad. Smile a little!\"\n\"You should know that names given by us Yougou Tengu are blessed with divine powers.\"\n\"Besides, the name 'rock' suits you — it certainly suits your mind and your muscles, that's for sure.\"\n\n\"Well then, when the cherry blossoms fall next year, let's have a duel here, 'Iwakura.'\"\n\"Child of the oni, hone your swordsmanship and become a foe whom the Yougou Tengu would not be ashamed to cross swords with.\"\n\"Ah, yes! If you manage to touch me, you'll get to call your secret blade 'Tengu Victor'!\"\n\"After all, if you get to that point, you'll have a sword that'll let you 'triumph over the tengu.'\""

Well then...\"\n\nTeruyo, shall we change the venue for our duel next year?\nThere are a few places I know of where you can also see the scarlet sakura falling...\nAs he looked around at the small shrine he had destroyed, holding the tengu's trembling hand,\nThese words lay on the tip of Michihiro's tongue even as he stared at the black feathers that he had sliced off.\n\n\"You did touch me, after all. I must admit that this is clearly your victory.\"\n\nVictory has not been decided yet. Let's meet again next year, he wanted to say.\n\n\"Now, your sword can even surpass the speed of a tengu.\"\n\"I will never forget a single one of our duels in these past thirteen years.\"\n\"But as a Tengu, I have duties to the clan that I must fulfill.\"\n\"Thinking back, I changed your name in hopes that you might escape from the curse of the oni bloodline.\"\n\"With that war, non-human blood grows thinner and thinner.\"\n\"Ah well. We should not covet the happy endings that humans enjoy, after all. But you're different.\"\n\"You are now 'Iwakura.' You are no longer the 'Mikoshi' who shoulders the burden of oni blood.\"\n\n\"Goodbye, Michihiro, and please forget me.\"\n\"Use your sword for the Iwakura bloodline... and open a path that belongs to the Iwakura alone.\""

You're such a headache.\"\n\"Other than your swordsmanship, you're just an idiotic old gambler, aren't you?\"\n\n\"Hmph. Don't you look down on me. I learned my archery from a tengu, you know? It's pretty famous, too.\"\n\"It's just that I'm too good with a sword, you know? That's why no one ever talks about my archery.\"\n\"Actually, now that I think about it, that's such a waste of good archery. How about I teach it to you, then?\"\n\nOnce upon a time, you mended that idiot's broken seal cage, all the while speaking those harsh words...\nOnce upon a time, though you used harsh words to divert others, you could not help but smile faintly.\n\n\"Please. You're already a Hatamoto with important responsibilities. Why are you still running around looking for trouble?\"\n\"And you're already married too, to a sweet wife no less. Why do you spend your days wandering and gambling, huh?\"\n\nYou're already...\nThe question was on the edge of your lips, but you were unable to ask, and you decided never to bring it up again.\nIf the Lady Saiguu had been here with you, she would surely have put it in a clever and merry way...\n\n\"It doesn't matter anymore. I gave myself a holiday, at least for today.\"\n\"Let's leave that whole shrine business behind and sneak off to the seaside, just like we did when you were little.\"\n\nAnd so he dragged you to the harbor, where you watched the ships sailing back and forth, as if in a trance.\nYou listened to him talk about Teruyo of the shrine, and how she had inherited her master's beauty and skill.\nYou listened to him talk about his terrifying nightmares, in which he cut off his own head...\nBut you both knew that those were just words to hide the melancholy of adulthood.\n\nLater, a long time later,\nOverlooking the mossy reefs and the harbor where the two of you once had that quiet rendezvous...\nFor the gambler to win his bet again, for the sake of praying for his safety...\nOnce again, you dared to stand upon those heights, holding up the seal cage that you made with your own hands.\nBearing the hope of retrieving those memories, you gathered the power of thunder and lightning."
