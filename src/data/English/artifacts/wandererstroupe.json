		"story": "A small flower-shaped insignia. There seems to be music coming from it.\n\nAmong the members of the troupe was a charismatic swordswoman.\nBeautiful as the light on water, elegant as the chirping lark.\nHer every slash hummed a tune of the wind.\n\nThe end of each song and dance was like the sun after the rain.\nDust has since settled, and both the stage and life itself feel emptier for the absence of her music.\n\nBoth her music and her sword were as lethal as they were beautiful.\nThis was in keeping with the troupe's performances, which were intended for two very different audiences.\nFor the audience of foes, the music drifted far beyond the stage."

They performed not only for friends, but also for foes.\nThey traveled through the desert and set foot in the blazing Mare Jivari.\n\nThe tune of the harp echoing in the kettle was a reminder for them.\n\"Along with the boundless tunes we walk.\"\n\"Wherever there is music, there is us.\""

What they saw was what they sung, and what they heard was what they played.\nAs time passed, the troupe gradually realized the vastness of the world.\n\n\"There are so many things in the world for us to sing of.\"\n\nThe members then turned the notes into words and recorded their journey in a book.\nThis book, The Widsith as they called it, was still held tightly in the conductor's hands even after his death."
