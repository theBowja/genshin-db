It bursts through the sky and is gone in a flash.\nEven the Thundersoother could not conquer the flash of time.\n\nWithin this hourglass, even thunder and lightning have to obey the never-changing law of time.\nIn the hourglass, the shards shatter and merge countless times while time silently flashes by.\nObserving this taught the Thundersoother about the cycle of life and death. Empowered with this knowledge, he was able to defeat the beast."
