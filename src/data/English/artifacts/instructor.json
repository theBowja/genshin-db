		"story": "Every student in the school knew that the strict instructor was a serious soldier.\nBut every week, there would always be a day or two when the instructor would wear this yellow flower brooch on his chest.\nThe smile on the instructor's face would always bring the students a sense of relief.\nFor when the instructor wore the yellow flower brooch, it meant that they could take a day off and go home.\nOnce his boisterous students had finally gone, the instructor would visit a silent graveyard.\nThere, after a moment of silence, he would pay his respects to the familiar names carved on the tombstones."
