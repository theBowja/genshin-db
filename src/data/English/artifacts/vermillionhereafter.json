A good cause indeed.\"\n\"Yet, if you think about it, this would be akin to a fish sinking into a deep pool or a bird plummeting into a forge.\"\n\"I may yet achieve my own desire, but we shall go unknown, and ultimately unremembered.\"\n\"Mortals like us are like feathers caught up in a whirlwind, floating into the deep sky.\"\n\"Saving, defending... In the end, these are all pointless things, void of meaning.\"\n\nThese dark murmurings shook the hearts of those who would never make a name for themselves.\n\nBut the battle was over in the end, and many a soldier would rest eternally in the cavernous depths.\nThe freakish cries of the dark forces were also silenced like fading ripples...\nAnd though mortal spans are short, the land will forever remember."

I mean, you can't trust these baseless folktales, can you?\"\n\"The merchants of Shenglu Hall have long left their obscurity and forgotten their past.\"\n\"Glittering Sand Crystal cannot easily be made into lacquerware, after all, nor is it suited to making luxury paints.\"\n\"According to the miners at The Chasm — and mind you don't believe this story too readily either—\"\n\"This timepiece and sand crystal came from the Millelith five hundred years ago.\"\n\nIn the lightless abyss where light wrestled against darkness, even one with a Yaksha's might could not hold out for long.\nAnd all the more did mere mortals need light to prevent them from getting lost in the steel curtain of devouring night.\nThe Millelith thus collected glowing sand to light the way, and it just so happened to resemble the pale moonlight.\nThe timepiece for its part told of the time they spent there in the abyss, and serves as proof that where they fell, others have come after to take up their duty."
