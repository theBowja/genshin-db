Hence, illusory visions were born out of concrete reality.\"\n\"The so-called omamori cannot make one's wishes come true at all, but they can make them eternal through this entanglement.\"\n\nThe Lady Kitsune couldn't help but break out into laughter upon seeing my clueless expression.\nShe cheerfully knocked my head with her pipe and sneakily changed the subject.\n\n\"I suppose you've met your fated one as well, Hibiki?\"\n\n\"What sort of 'fate' could there be with a rude and reckless brute like that!\"\n\n\"Oh, is that so?\"\n\nBut darkness engulfed everything in the end.\nThat \"fate,\" too, was no more."

		"story": "A demon-slaying arrow used by the shrine for prayers and to drive away catastrophes,\nIt is said to be capable of pursuing and destroying all demons.\n\nPeople often say that demon-slaying arrows can drive away evil, but evil is never an objective thing.\nEvil often stems from within our hearts, born out of delirious minds that have turned cold and ashen from terror.\nLady Saiguu has been gone for a long time now, and I am no longer that young shrine maiden training at the Grand Narukami Shrine.\nWhenever I hold that empty smoking pipe, I can feel that emptiness and dull pain hover over me like a phantom.\n\nHaving someone worth missing, losing someone whom I cannot help missing... And time keeps moving like a spinning wheel.\nSilent and tranquil, the Lady Kitsune's white form hidden in the deep darkness left a deep impression in the shrine maiden's dreams.\nThe Great Tengu went into self-imposed exile, enraged at her own incompetence as the Lady Saiguu's protector, leaving Teruyo behind.\nHarunosuke left for another country amid the fury of his mourning, while Nagamasa joined the Shogunate to clear the Mikoshi name.\nAs for the man who taught me archery in the sacred forest and patiently listened to my naïve promise under the scarlet sakura boughs,\nHe will eventually return to me, even if he were to be blinded by splattered blood, or turned into a fierce beast by that dark defilement...\n\nI shall save him with our bow and arrows, to keep our promise, which ever veers towards breaking.\nI shall destroy evil with our bow and arrows, exorcising folly and needless obsession.\n\n\"Come see me, you idiotic problem gambler.\"\n\"And don't lose your way this time, Konbumaru.\"\n\nStill, who won the last throw of the dice...\nShe touched the bow lightly while pondering such unimportant things."

All you have seen of me is but a residual vision, born of your wishes.\"\n\nIn that vague memory, she kept saying some incomprehensible things. Her expression as sorrowful as the eighth month's moon, and I suddenly...\nThen she rapped me over the head with her tobacco pipe, wearing her usual expression of rebuke and mockery:\n\n\"Hibiki, the sun's about to rise.\"\n\"We should head back.\""

Now, even someone as dull-witted as I am has learned how to talk like a mighty kitsune.\nDuring this time, even someone as inhuman as the mighty Yougou Tengu has gotten a daughter.\nEven that leatherhead Konbumaru has also become one of the Shogun's own Hatamoto, and shall soon marry the daughter of a high-ranking samurai.\n\n\"Such a lovely kid.

That's not good. Say, Hibiki, how would you like to be a kid again?\"\n\nThe Lady Kitsune's joke was out of line as always, coming forth with the self-serving scent of sakura wine.\n\n\"Aw, Hibiki, why the long face? How about this, then? I, the Lady Saiguu, shall tell your fortune for you!\"\n\"Haha, see? See, it's \"Great Fortune.\" \"Great Fortune\"! You know what that means?\"\n\"It means that you took away all the bad fortune slips. Please stop mocking me, Lady Saiguu.\"\n\"No... it means that the person you're missing will be lucky enough to become a part of your memories forever.\"\n\nThat's why you have to be strong and must live on for a long, long time.\nEven if all the people you cherish are gone, as long as you are still alive,\nThe time you spent with them will never perish..."
