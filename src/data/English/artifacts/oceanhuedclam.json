At the end of the duration, the Sea-Dyed Foam will explode, dealing DMG to nearby opponents based on 90% of the accumulated healing. (This DMG is calculated similarly to Reactions such as Electro-Charged, and Superconduct, but is not affected by Elemental Mastery, Character Levels, or Reaction DMG Bonuses). Only one Sea-Dyed Foam can be produced every 3.5 seconds. Each Sea-Dyed Foam can accumulate up to 30,000 HP (including overflow healing). There can be no more than one Sea-Dyed Foam active at any given time. This effect can still be triggered even when the character who is using this artifact set is not on the field.",

Its core is adorned with pure pearls.\nThe songs of Watatsumi Island say that these flowers bloom in the pearl-lit depths.\nSteeped in the lovesickness of the diving sea-daughters and the gentle moonlight, they would give off a pearly gleam.\n\nWhen all conflicts have ceased, the sea beasts shall no longer weep for their lonesome companions,\nAnd when the moonlight rises over Touzan, the lovely deity shall rise and sing.\n\"Come, sea-daughters, come and see, O people of my heart, for the moon is out tonight.\"\n\"Though Touzan might fall this night, the lightning and the storm can never hide the moon's pearly glory...\"\n\nThe lonesome maiden will sing and dance upon the moon-silver waves.\nThe divers shall forget the pain of loss, and even the tender flowers will regain their vibrance."
