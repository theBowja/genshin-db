		"description": "A tiara worn by those tasked with offering sacrifices in ancient times. Because it once weathered years of the icy cold, it possesses remarkable resistance.",
		"story": "They say that,\nThe line of chief priests have always seen this same sight as their days draw to an end:\nA mountain of crowns in a secret place, beneath a withered tree—\n—each one hiding a lifetime of secrets kept.\nEach retiring chief priest offers up their crown of flawless white branches to this world.\nEvery mighty and ancient city, and every austere place of sacrifice must one day return to profundity in the earth.\n\nAll prosperity must someday end.\nBut this does not mean that nothing is eternal.\n\nAt the end of a cycle, the earth shall be renewed. Thus eternity is cyclical.\nThe search for truth is a product of prosperity, and not the seed that plants it.\n\nThey say that,\nOnce upon a time, the people of the land could hear revelations from Celestia directly.\nThe envoys of the gods walked among benighted humanity then. In those days, life was weak, and the earth was blanketed in unending ice."
