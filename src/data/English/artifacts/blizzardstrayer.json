		"story": "This is a flower of ever-frost, plucked by a pair of gentle hands.\nIt must have given a certain someone the strength to see winter as a warm embrace.\n\n\"This fourth fresco is prepared for you. Your likeness will forever remain on this wall.\"\n\"For the sake of that fresco, and for everyone's sake, I will wait for you, and pray for your return...\"\n\nThe maiden stood before a blank wall, and smiling, she pinned a small flower to the hero's breast.\nThat was an elegant and unruffled fellow, who would never bat an eyelid, not even in the face of death itself.\n\nThe heroism of the Icebreaker was forgotten, buried in the storms of the North.\nSince then, the snow has melted — but this flower has not withered."

		"story": "A feather of a bird of prey that did not originally belong in the winter chill. It is cold to the touch.\nAnd when you do touch it, it is as if you can hear cries in the snowstorm, unbowed but bereft of hope.\n\nWith no nest or shelter, the bird faced the storms proudly.\nThis feather has been assailed with coalescing ice and snow, leaving it coated in pearls of frost.\n\nIt once came from a falcon in flight and was plucked violently from that bird by the frigid winds.\nIt drifted a while in the air before the weight of the frost dragged it back down to the ground.\n\n\"I believe that the lively birds will follow you, and return to the gardens of the summer palace, now green once more.\"\n\"Those who have been chased away by the chilling tide, and those children who have lost their homes, they will return with you to the home of their dreams.\"\n\nThe hero, bearing such great burdens on his back, halted in the whipping snow, struggling to discern the color of that feather.\nSealed in ice, that feather's color faded every step of the way — just like the hero's task."

Do not accompany us unto our doom — to languish forgotten in the snow.\"\n\nTaking another swig of bitter wine to steel himself for the journey, he turned away from the maiden's wet eyes,\nAnd he would set out on an unending pursuit, towards the land of snow and profundity."
