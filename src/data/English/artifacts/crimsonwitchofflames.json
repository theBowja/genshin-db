		"story": "A common species of flower.\nIt is curiously capable of resisting the Crimson Witch's flames.\n\nA crisis centuries ago dashed all hope of the maiden seeing the future promised to her.\nThose dear to her, her past days, and her bright future. All gone.\n\nFrom the ashes, the Crimson Witch of Flame was born, and she burned away her pain with fire.\nYet this flower stayed resilient, soft, and moist.\nPerhaps both painful and beautiful memories were two sides of the same coin."

But none of that mattered to her.\n\nNew hopes were birthed from the fires of old pains.\nShe needed not comforting nor sympathy.\nChirping by her side, the birds gave her all the understanding she needed."

The Crimson Witch of Flame was born, and with her the era of destruction.\nThe timepiece bore witness to the days of monsters and the pain they caused, until all were burned away."
