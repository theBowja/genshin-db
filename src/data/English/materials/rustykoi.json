	"name": "Rusty Koi",
	"description": "A large fish said to be the descendant of dragons.\nThis is a variant species of Koi, and is sometimes termed the \"awakened dragon\" amongst them. In stark contrast to its rather shabby appearance, the Rusty Koi has shed its opulent gold tabard in exchange for a hard armor of rusty bronze. Very strong-willed, it will fight any interloper that dares to steal its food or enter its territory. In terms of pure fighting capability, it is even a match for smaller sea monsters and has thus been given the nickname \"Ironbone Dragon\" in honor of its strength, which is considered the backbone of its species' future revitalization.",
