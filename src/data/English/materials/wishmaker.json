	"description": "If you can stay within the Ideal Tension Zone while fishing, this rod will shorten the time in which fish will struggle by a stable amount and increase your chances of success. This effect only works in Liyue.\n\nA long rod that stands like elegant bamboo. It is said to have been constructed and kept by a skilled hermit from Liyue, and it was first discovered on a stone tablet with the following words carved upon it: \"O you who aspire, take up this rod,\" like a legendary sword waiting for a hero to pull it out. Of course, you only ever hear this glorious origin story from the mouths of merchants, so it may just be some rhetoric used to increase the item's value... But those who know this and still use this rod can only be those who are ready and willing to accept this pact.",
