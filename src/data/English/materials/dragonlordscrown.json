	"description": "Horns created from hardened jade crystallized over a thousand years are the natural crown of the dragon king.\nInfused with spirit and carved from bedrock, it was born from the mountain's heart to show the strength of the earth to the land amidst monoliths, and its long golden horns are the mark of its ancient strife with an ancient lord.\nFor a time, this horn was shattered and lost its luster, but now it gleams cold and gold as it sits in your palm.",
