	"description": "If you can stay within the Ideal Tension Zone while fishing, this rod will shorten the time in which fish will struggle by a stable amount and increase your chances of success. This effect only works in Sumeru.\n\nThis archaic Sumeru fishing rod is carved like white jade, decorated with dark gold patterns, and embellished with green gems. Under its pure aesthetics, it seems to have some meaning related to \"life\" â€” it is said that the oldest fishing rod of Sumeru was a branch wrapped with vines, and many master anglers achieved miraculous catches with such rods. Today's fishermen also believe that such fishing rods with long histories will bring them good luck.",
