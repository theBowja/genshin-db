	"description": "A crystal that gives off an iridescent glow. Exceptionally tough and malleable, it has been regarded by Snezhnayan craftspeople as the best forging material since ancient times.\nIt is believed that when the moon's chariot was shattered, its blood-stained axle-tip fell into the earthly realm beneath the moon, transforming into an iridescent crystal. From that day on, the people of this land no longer worshipped the dead gods. The survivors who knew what the monarchs of the night died for, however, still futilely sing those long-forgotten names.",
