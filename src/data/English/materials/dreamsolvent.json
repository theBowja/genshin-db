	"description": "An item capable of changing Character Level-Up Materials obtained from memories and trials into whatever form is needed.\nPeople once believed that spirits and memories had some material form. If someone dreamed of heaven before waking up clutching a flower, then that blossom must have been made from such a fantasy. Dream Solvent dissolves that which is obtained from memory and transforms it into some other dream.\nIndeed, blows traded with the strong are stepping stones towards becoming stronger yourself.",
