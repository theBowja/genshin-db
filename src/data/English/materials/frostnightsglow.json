	"description": "A chunk taken from the horned crown of a defeated Frostnight Scion.\nIn the oldest sagas of the Frostmoon Scions, the glow of these noble creatures was described as the \"unsullied mercy of the divine emissary\" by the philosophers of the far north. Though this mercy could not prevent the fall of the Golden City or save her descendants from exile, the same glow still courses through their horned crowns, waiting for a dream that may never return.",
