	"description": "A pebble commonly found on Nod-Krai's coasts, characterized by a naturally occurring hollow. Touching it sends a faint chill through your finger.\nAccording to ancient legends, the hollows in these pebbles were once shelters revealed to the fae by the Frost Moon â€” gateways to the ethereal. In another story popular in Nasha Town, the legendary thief, Reed Miller, was surrounded when a runestone given to him by a holy lady of the Frost Moon as a token of her love allowed him to conceal himself and escape his pursuers. Naturally, the Frostmoon Scions vehemently reject this claim, as these pebbles do not display any such magical properties.",
