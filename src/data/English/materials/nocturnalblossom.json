	"description": "A flower in two entwined colors with a strong affinity for kuuvahki. Its light fragrance and conspicuous color have made it an excellent natural dye.\nIts contrasting colors are thought to symbolize the two different types of kuuvahki, so the followers of the Frostmoon Scions sometimes regard it as the Moon Maiden's blessing.\nIt is said that this strangely shaped flower first appeared decades after the dark calamity ended five hundred years ago, a claim widely reflected in the verses of the Frostmoon Scions, though it has never been rigorously verified.",
