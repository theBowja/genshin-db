	"description": "Compact assistance meka developed to increase the overall utilization rates of meka teams, providing aid for underwater projects. They were originally designed to remove junk, vegetation, and other underwater debris in order to prevent these from clogging up the vital parts of other clockwork meka, thereby minimizing failure rates. From another point of view, they are undoubtedly benefiting Fontaine's ecosystem greatly as underwater cleaners.\nEquipped with high-sensitivity sensors, the meka can efficiently \"nose out\" target items through smells as well as detect the optical characteristics of underwater junk. As a result, they can be attracted by certain types of bait and are occasionally caught by anglers, who refer to them as \"Water Maintenance Fish\" or \"Iron Fish.\"\nMade of light wood and cheap metal, this model represents the first batch of Maintenance Mek produced after achieving reliable manufacture, and possesses the fundamental capabilities required to fulfill the purpose for which they were designed. Their lifespan, however, is somewhat limited. To make up for that, this model was released in great numbers, and they work in \"group shifts\" â€“ when one group stops functioning after reaching the end of their life cycle, another group that has been deployed underwater beforehand is then activated and takes the next shift. In the eyes of ordinary people, these \"Iron Fishes\" seem to be able to reproduce themselves in a never-ending stream. Catching a few of them from time to time is certainly no cause for a guilty conscience.",
