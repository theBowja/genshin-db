	"description": "A dazzling fish with a translucent, crystal-like head, often seen gliding through the waters of Nod-Krai. Its bright blue hue calls to mind a cloudless sky, earning it the poetic name \"Azuregaze.\"\nResearchers have found that its head is filled with a protective fluid, housing its actual eyes, which can rotate freely to scan its surroundings with ease. Yet many creatures misinterpret the markings on either side of its mouth as closed eyes, assuming it's sound asleep... even when it's wide awake and watching.",
