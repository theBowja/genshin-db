	"description": "A gentle, elegant butterflyfish variant. It has a lovely, streamlined dorsal fin, and has the nickname \"Queen of the Waters.\"\nEarthen-colored patterns run across its body, and its temper is also as steady as stone. They can go a bit overboard, however, and will sometimes lie at the bottom and not move an inch, just like a rock, leading some buyers to think that they've bought some hopelessly moribund old fish.",
