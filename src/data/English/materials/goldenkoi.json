	"description": "A large fish said to be the descendant of dragons.\nWith the horn on its head and its scaleless form clad as if in golden armor, it looks every bit like a king underwater. In truth, its bloodline and behavior could not be more different from that of a dragon â€” it can neither call forth the wind and rain nor the power of domination and is actually often the victim of food-snatching due to its weak character. A real shame, of course, that it looks so very majestic. As such, it lost the nickname \"Descendant of Dragons,\" and is now termed the \"False Dragon\" instead.",
