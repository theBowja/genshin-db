	"description": "A pillar formed by the shell of a Geo Hypostasis, composed of high-density Geo energy.\nIt is a testament to Geo's status as the heaviest of the elements. Maybe the reason a Geo Hypostasis creates this pillar out of its shell and raises itself is just to get closer to the sky, not to combat enemies.",
