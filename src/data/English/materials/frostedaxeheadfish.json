	"description": "A fish with unique morphology and family ties to the Axe Marlins. Some biologists have theorized that the species split when the Axe Marlins took an evolutionary gamble on axe-shaped bellies, while the Axehead Fishes doubled down on axe-shaped skulls.\nWith their bluish-violet backs, these Axehead Fish were once mistaken by ordinary anglers as a rare and valuable species from \"northern waters where the sea ice floats.\" As a result, they were often kept and raised in near-freezing conditions. In truth, their unique coloring comes not from the cold but from a diet quite different from that of the Common Axehead Fish. For researchers studying the nutrient pathways of local aquatic ecosystems, these fish make for a surprisingly useful sample node in the food chain.",
