	"description": "The electricity-emitting section of the Millennial Pearl Seahorse, and its regalia, the symbol of its surpassing might — now snapped off amidst a clash against a mighty challenger.\nAs the greatest predator that can arise from seahorses, this being's evolutionary journey is not the same as that experienced by other Fontemer Aberrants. It did not start from a base form before growing larger and stronger, but instead grew limbs and a horn that have no place on an ordinary seahorse. Even its musculature and skeleton have changed. It really seems to resemble a fantastical beast from legends of yore more than its original shape. In the imaginations of poets and authors, even seahorses can frolick upon the earth.",
