	"description": "A primordial flower procured from the oasis within Apep.\nWith the passing of eons, flowers grew in fragrance and volume, and they gained a collection of titles as numerous as the stars in the night sky.\nHowever, this first flower to bloom never bore any name. For the dragons of old, even if a rose lost its name, it would not lose its scent. Naming things is but how lesser, ephemeral beings understand the world. Life is not constrained by words, and will always grow and evolve.",
