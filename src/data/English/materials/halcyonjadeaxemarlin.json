	"name": "Halcyon Jade Axe Marlin",
	"description": "A medium-sized fish with unique morphology and Sumeru's cousin to the butterfly fish. This fish has a broad skeleton and a unique curved body. Legend has it that the first fishermen to catch this fish had their rods tilted at the end of the tail fin and found that the two, when combined, resemble a polearm, hence giving rise to the name \"Axe Marlin.\" This name has made much more of an impression than its scientific name, the \"Anchor Hook Butterfly,\" and it is thus colloquially used amongst most people.\nThe jade-colored Axe Marlin prefers to live in areas where aquatic plants flourish, and where its shape easily blends in with the background. Small fish that wander through the grass often bump into their camouflaged bodies and become dazed, but the marlin doesn't feel provoked, and will instead offer shelter to its neighbors.",
