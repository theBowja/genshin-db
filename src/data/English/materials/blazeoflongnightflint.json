All they could rely on was weak flesh clad in silver armor, the swords and lamps in their hands, and an ancient oath passed down through generations.\nNo matter how many souls perish beneath the dim light, the dark disaster cannot overturn mortal resolve â€” for the long night can only steal life, and not the dawn that will eventually rise.",
