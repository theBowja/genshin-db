	"description": "If you can stay within the Ideal Tension Zone while fishing, this rod will shorten the time in which fish will struggle by a stable amount and increase your chances of success. This effect only works in Nod-Krai.\n\nA fishing rod that shimmers with a pure, silvery glow, like moonlight caught in its frame. It's a masterpiece reserved for true masters among Nod-Krai's anglers, those who have reached the highest levels of the craft. It is said that the last wielder of this rod treated every catch as a quiet exchange rather than a contest. Some fish were released right away, while others were invited home for a short visit in the aquarium — before being gently returned to the waters they came from. This thoughtful, respectful way of fishing gave rise to a unique tradition among local anglers — one that values connection and care over mere skill.",
