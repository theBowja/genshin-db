	"description": "A peculiar type of fish with a single horn. Round and firm, its belly is as bouncy as a balloon... Actually, there really is a balloon-like swim bladder in there.\nWhile the Phony Phlogiston Unihornfish can provide graffiti enthusiasts with precious paints, they can only live in liquid phlogiston environments. Thus, the Graffiti Alliance began to explore raising this kind of fish in ordinary aqueous environments. To accomplish this, the previous Graffiti Alliance's leader's previous predecessor began to work with the Natlan Fishing Association, expending an enormous sum to import clockwork fish from Fontaine, using \"Maintenance Mek\" tech to build an ecological simulation mek with onboard data collection capabilities and conduct extensive observations and research. Alas, the results were most disappointing: the horn-like crystal structures on Unihornfish heads ceased to shine with flame-like light after the fish left their liquid phlogiston environment, and so, the plan ended in failure.\nFortunately, due to the way their dorsal fin extends above the water while they swim, these mek Unihornfish look kind of like sharks from a distance. Thanks to this, the People of the Springs ended up buying an appropriate quantity of these \"Pseudoshark Unihornfish\" from the Graffiti Alliance and Natlan Fishing Association. They are used for giving tourists who go surfing a thrilling yet safe experience, as well as to scare lawbreakers in certain waters.",
