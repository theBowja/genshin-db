	"description": "A rare Medaka that glitters like crystal. Its patterns are very intricate indeed, to the point where it is often called the \"Medaka Aesthete.\"\nSome merchants will claim that these Medaka will lay a crystal pearl under certain extreme conditions and that this pearl is both an item of great price and a sign of quality. This has made these fish very sought after by people from all walks of life and caused their market value to soar. However, this is just amusing to the fishermen, who know the inside story: That object is merely a Loach Pearl that the fish ate by mistake. It rolled into the fish's salty intestines, only to spat back out of the mouths of merchants with an agenda. Some grounds for a price hike that is!",
