After returning from the kingdom of dragons, the usurper once pondered this question.\nCombining the immortal stone with the Ichor essence extracted from primordial water, and carved into a race as black as iron — with arcane lithos for skin and Ichor for blood, never again fearing the curse of returning to the primeval past...\nThe silent golem still dreams the dream of the empire — not knowing it has been over a thousand years since the empire's obliteration.",
