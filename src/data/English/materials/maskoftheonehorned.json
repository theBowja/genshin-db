He was once a beloved lieutenant of the Shogun, and he followed her into the dark abyssal realms to repel the defiled ones, winning renown for the oni, whose blood thinned with each passing day.\nNone now sing these songs, but the mask of a horned oni, even in a different form, still possesses power beyond the norm.",
