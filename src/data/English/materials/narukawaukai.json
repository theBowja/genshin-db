	"description": "If you can stay within the Ideal Tension Zone while fishing, this rod will shorten the time in which fish will struggle by a stable amount and increase your chances of success. This effect only works in Inazuma.\n\nA rod created to commemorate the ancient Ukai, or Cormorant, fishing method. The ruby-red gem at the tip of the rod represents the tinder used by the cormorant fishers, and the bird ornaments along the rod's shaft represent the cormorants themselves, who helped the hard-working Inazumans pass through those cataclysmic years. This low-efficiency fishing method has long become obsolete, but the persevering, pioneering spirit has been passed down together with this rod.",
