Every month, the moon sends down new blessings — but wow, it's going to be almost nine thousand more hours before we can celebrate this day again! The time we spent together is like chocolate — sweet, soft, and too good to be savored in one bite... Mmmm! You're Paimon's favorite travel partner!\"",
