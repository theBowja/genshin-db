	"description": "Specialized refinement material for \"Rainbow Serpent's Rain Bow.\"\nA brightly colored, exquisitely crafted finger guard long worn by archers.\nThe accuracy of an arrow hinges on the archer's experience: The more one draws the bowstring with focused breath, the more seamlessly bow and arrow move in unison. To nock and draw is to temper the spirit. The wear on the guard reflects the sharpness of the archer's resolve.",
