	"description": "Weapon Ascension Material.\nWhen intangible spirits attach themselves to objects, they merge and transform into various forms through a process known as spiritual fusion. Once this has taken place, these spirits are capable of conveying dreamlike visions to humans in a state of trance.\nIt fell upon those who frequently engaged in such dialogues with the spirits to interpret these vision-like dreams, translating omens from beneath the earth into language that could be understood by the tribe, or transforming their warnings into stories. It is said that this is the origin of the tribal storytellers, and also why most outstanding storytellers hail from the Night-Wind.",
