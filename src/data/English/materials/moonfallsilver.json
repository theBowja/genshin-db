	"description": "A silver crystal as pure and pristine as moonlight. It possesses almost perfect elemental affinity.\nIn the legacy of the Frostmoon Scions, these crystals were born five hundred years ago alongside the Moon Maiden, and were believed by the Moonchanter at the time to be a gift from the moon, hence the name \"Moonfall Silver\". However, in older documents written by Snezhnayan chroniclers, the descendants of the golden realm were already using secret silver woven by the Frostmoon thousands of years in the past. The threads that connect these two tales are unclear â€” the only certain thing is that these crystals make excellent elemental conductors in the eyes of Nod-Krai's craftspeople.",
