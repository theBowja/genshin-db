	"description": "Specialized refinement material for Ibis Piercer.\nIn the Great Red Sand, the youth who later became the King of Invokations was requested by the descendants of the Ibis King to spend a few days formulating bowstring wax from Sand Grease Pupae. However, the legendary bow disappeared along with the Ibis King, and only the recipe for making pupa wax was passed down from generation to generation. Perhaps it's still waiting for the day when it can be used again.",
