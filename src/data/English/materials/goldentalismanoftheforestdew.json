Instead, it is about empowering even ordinary beings to one day overcome their imposed constraints.\nThough the roar of the tiger is no longer heard in the forest and the resilient guardians would seclude themselves within the dreams of children... On the night when every secret golden seal is lifted and all dreams glow like amber in the moonlight, perhaps she and her beloved people will eventually win genuine freedom.",
