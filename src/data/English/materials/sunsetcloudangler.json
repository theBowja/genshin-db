	"name": "Sunset Cloud Angler",
	"description": "A medium-sized, round fish with horn-like cartilage that is used to dig underwater burrows, build shelters and drive away creatures that try to harm it.\nAs the longest-living species of pufferfish, they have a light gray color and are easy to identify. The color comes from their unique way of survival â€” their cutis contains a substance similar to bile, which is far more acidic than that of other fish, causing them to be shunned by many underwater creatures.\nBut when cooked in a special way, the acidity actually adds to the freshness of the fish. As a result, this fish sells very well. At Sumeru's fish markets, you can often see signs that say: \"Do not keep Sunset Cloud Anglers in the same tank as other fish meant for consumption.\"",
