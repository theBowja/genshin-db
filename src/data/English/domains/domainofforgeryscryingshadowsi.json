	"description": "The great dragon erected many peculiar structures across the land. In the ancient legends, the great dragon's outstretched wings could together blot out the light of the sky. Perhaps such descriptions were not hyperbole, or perhaps such wording was a metaphor for their desire to see beyond the sky.\nBut now, the traces of said ancient dragon have already vanished, and the people of today can only but glimpse the forging techniques of that ancient civilization through the shattered remnants of those massive structures and their patterns.",
