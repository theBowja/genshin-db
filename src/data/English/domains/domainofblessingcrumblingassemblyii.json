		"After a character obtains an Elemental Shard created by the Crystallize reaction, they will gain the Crystal Empowerment state. The ATK of active characters in this state is increased by 20% for 10s. This state can stack up to 3 times, with the duration of each stack counted independently. If another Elemental Shard is obtained while you already have 3 stacks, release a Geo shockwave that deals Geo DMG to nearby opponents. 1 such shockwave can be triggered every 10s."
