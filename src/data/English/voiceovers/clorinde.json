I have a gift for you — it's a short-sword necklace that I made myself.\nIn the Marechaussee Hunters' tradition, on a new member's first birthday as a hunter, {M#his}{F#her} mentor will make {M#him}{F#her} a short-sword necklace with {M#his}{F#her} name engraved, to be worn with the sword hanging over the chest. This is to symbolize interrogating {M#his}{F#her} own heart at swordpoint: Will I tread the path of treachery, is there doubt in my heart, or am I resolved to eradicate all evil?\nThough you're not a Marechaussee Hunter, I believe that you're committed, like I am, to fighting the good fight.\nWhy a sword, and not a musket? Because guns can misfire. Also, there's something a little inelegant about interrogating your heart at gunpoint.",
