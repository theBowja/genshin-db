When one considers that Fungi evolved from spores, perhaps this one might even be the foundation for a further evolution into some new life form altogether — if given time, that is.\nThis creature has a position of command amongst colonies of fungal beasts and exhibits heightened intelligence to match.",

At first, a certain sage had hopes of utilizing spores for medical purposes. If that is true, the person had clearly underestimated the spores' adaptive and reproductive powers."
