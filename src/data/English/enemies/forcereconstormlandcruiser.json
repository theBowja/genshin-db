	"description": "An autonomous machine that applies the principles of naval combat to land battles, a literal \"armed ship that cruises on land.\"\nEquipped with Crawler Track Movement Mechanisms, these Landcruisers are normally used to storm enemy positions, where they can pass over rough terrain such as mud and melting snow despite heavy armor and armaments through their excellent load-bearing capabilities and off-road mobility. Force Recon armaments include a multi-barrel automatic gun, allowing this Landcruiser to adjust its tactics to both close quarters and long-range combat. Whether it be long-range observation or obtaining enemy intel in the midst of fearsome firefights, this Landcruiser model is more than up to the task.",
