According to the storytellers, when the greatest of such dragons spread its wings, the entire sky would be blotted out. Of course, the Qucusaurs we see today no longer possess such forms, but the claws they hide within their downy feather coats remain as sharp as ever.",

It is said that after losing their power, they were forced to become ever more dependent on their environments for survival, finally settling into the forms they still have as Saurians today.\\nBut whether this is true or not, no one really knows."
