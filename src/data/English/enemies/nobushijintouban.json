Though they are called the Nobushi, they do not have a centralized organization.\nHaving pursued the path of a martial artist for a long time, they possess highly advanced sword skills but no longer use them for good.\nSometimes, they even collude with the Treasure Hoarders or Fatui out of a greed for wealth — or simply to survive."
