Their ability to manipulate weapons with ease comes instead from years of mental training. Thus, compared to combat prowess in itself, warriors from the Masters of the Night-Wind place greater value on the gift of \"Spiritspeaking.\" Drawing upon the power of special graffiti and willpower alone, it is said that the most exceptional of Spiritspeakers can lift boulders as tall as people.",
