This branch of their genus was able to survive by adapting more toward earth-based living, and became known as the \"Wenut.\"\nSome desert folk still mistakenly believe that Wenut is the final point of a quicksand eel's life cycle, likely due to superficial similarities between the species' behaviors.",

Others say that this is their way of fooling their prey to seek fruits or food in their deadly shade."
