	"description": "A muscular hilichurl that uses solid ice as a shield, wielding it in battle.\nReason normally dictates that large creatures that see a lot of action should burn through a great number of calories to sustain themselves. As such, the present-day El Musk has proposed the \"Mitachurl Index.\" This index correlates the percentage of mitachurls within the hilichurl population to the stability and success of hilichurl foraging activity."
