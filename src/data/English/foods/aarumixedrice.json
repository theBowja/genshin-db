In this dish that combines rice, noodles, and beans together, the secret of great taste lies in the sweet and sour flavor imparted by tomatoes. Owing to its common nature and low price, this dish is a great choice for sating one's hunger — which is one of the key reasons why this recipe has spread from Aaru Village to the rest of Sumeru.",

No oily meats were used to make this dish, and yet its flavor is more alluring still. This dish stacks flavor like the endless dunes themselves, bringing a most unique satisfaction."
