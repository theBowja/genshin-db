But how can one be sure that such stupendous effects are really not false advertising cooked up by some restaurant?",

A clear soup the combines the essence of the boundless blue skies above and the limitless land below, the aromas of meat and vegetables blended seamlessly into a greater whole. No wonder a columnist for The Steambird, once unable to squeeze out a single word onto the blank paper before them, drank a single bowl and immediately became a font of literary genius, every word nearly as exquisite as this dish."
