	"description": "A grilled dish. The sliced unagi has been steamed first to remove the excess fat before being grilled and sauced. There is no consensus in Inazuma as to where the name \"unagi\" came from, but everyone at least agrees that it will take a whole lifetime to master its making.",

		"description": "A grilled dish. The fat oils sizzle all across the meat's surface like a flowery prelude. The baptism of charcoal fire and moistening sauce has imparted a delicate softness to the unagi's mouthfeel. If you paired this with rice, you'd be liable to leave not even a single drop of sauce behind."
