	"story": "A strangely-shaped spear made by Kitain Bunsou for his own unique style of spearmanship.\nIts massive weight makes it extremely unwieldy in untrained hands.\nBut in the hands of an expert, it is capable of unleashing great destructive power.\n\nIn the distant past, Kitain used to be a family that hunted the Tatarigami down.\nFor many generations, they shouldered the responsibility of serving as the Prefects of Yashiori.\n\nIn the past, there was a certain children's song that circulated widely within Inazuma:\n\"Arataki of the Front Gate, Iwakura the Successor, Kitain the Serpent, Takamine the Mistsplitter.\"\nThese phrases describe the dazzling warriors who once illuminated the earth like comets.\nThere used to be many other names on the list, but they have since been lost to history.\nAnd having been a demon hunter for so long, it is unavoidable that one might imbibe some of that miasmic, tainted blood.",
