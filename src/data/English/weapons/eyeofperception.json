	"story": "A beauteous item fashioned from rare natural glaze.\nLegend has it that the Eye of Perception was once upon a time as bright, clear and smooth as a lake's surface, but became dulled over the passage of many years.\nFolk records claim that on a still night, one can hear it make soft noises.\nSometimes it sounds like a mild breeze, other times like a flowing spring.\n\nThey say that the Eye was an adeptus's heirloom that was passed down in Liyue and eventually found its way into the Yun family.\nNow one day, Yun was strolling about in the mountains, and there they happened to meet an exorcist named Huang, who had come to consult with the adepti.\nYun spoke with Huang enthusiastically and at length, and gifted the Eye to Huang. When Huang frantically declined, Yun said this with a smile:\n\"This pearl is nature's very quintessence. Only one whose heart is clear can use it.\"\n\nThanking Yun, Huang took the Eye and wore it on his person, and slowly made his way towards Liyue. Along the way, neither rain nor wind impeded him.\nAs one who sought after the path of the adepti, Huang wandered the lands without rest. Thus, he would often be at the market to buy water and food.\nThe harbor-side streets were a morass of humanity. Yet Huang walked among them as if idle, and was never taken advantage of.\nSome were curious: how could this bookish exorcist take to the city like a fish to water, and never miss a step?\nWhen asked, he replied: \"This Eye trembles at wickedness, and helps me see which hearts are true.\"\n\nThis Eye could reveal human hearts, though no one knows how it worked, causing many to fall back on folktales to explain it.\nSome say that at midnight, you can dimly hear it call out like a mild breeze, or like spring water flowing between scattered stones.\nBoth are reminiscent of the murmuring of demons that feed on wicked thoughts, a common feature of the parables once told by mothers to their children in days gone by.",
