	"story": "The sky-piercing fang.\nIt once pierced the black-gold scales of the kingdom of the abyss,\nand cut the throats of the sons of ancient sinners.\n\nMondstadt was once threatened by the shadow dragon Durin.\nIts jealousy for Mondstadt's prosperity begot evil, poisoning the land.\nIn those dark days, Mondstadt was surrounded by monsters and barren lands.\nHearing the people's cry for help, the Anemo Archon descended and awoke Dvalin.\nDvalin rode the wind and soared up to the sky, fighting for all life.\n\nBlessed by the Anemo Archon, Dvalin fought the shadow dragon.\nClouds broke, and the sky burned red as if the end of days was upon Mondstadt.\nEventually, Dvalin's blessed fangs pierced through the throat of Durin.\nDurin fell, but Dvalin was poisoned by Durin's tainted blood.\n\nUnable to bear the pain, Dvalin fell unconscious.\nEven the most learned bards knew not where he slumbered.\nCenturies passed, and Dvalin's sacrifice was all but forgotten by Mondstadt.\nWhen Dvalin finally awoke, gone was his friend and the sound of his comforting lyre.\nAnd the ones he once protected now cowered in fear at the sight of him.\n\nHonor reclaimed, poison cleansed,\nBallads shall give back a people's forgotten memory.\nA prayer, this sword is. May Dvalin's name be restored.",
