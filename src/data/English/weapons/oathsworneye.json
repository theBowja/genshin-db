I've had enough of it all — of eking out this existence, of being shamed for blasphemy.\"\n\nThe giant serpent then showed forth a jewel that glimmered like snake-eyes.\n\"In that case, swear it upon this eye.\"\n\"This was also how I made a pact with my coral servants.\"\n\n\"Have you forgotten Master Spartacus' teachings?\"\n\"We must never worship a god! We can only rely on ourselves!\"\nThe white serpent said nothing, for it respected the will of the people dwelling in the depths.\nIf vain worship was supplanted by new belief,\nThen would it not dishonor those who fought?\n\n\"I'll swear it. I'll swear it here, before this eye.\"\n\"All is as it was when I lost everything.\"\n\n\"The years have passed swiftly. The island is complete. The vishaps are repelled, and the Holy Soil may now be governed.\"\n\"House of Sangonomiya, gathered Jibashiri, and my vassals — the oath sworn upon the eye has come to fruition.\"\n\"From today, if two or more parties should be dissatisfied with the arrangement concerning Enkanomiya, or should you decide otherwise than you first did,\"\n\"May the tower of the sun hear your wishes and collapse of its own accord, destroying all that was once your past.\"\n\nSaying these final words,\nThe serpent god took the remaining people to the surface.\nIt was time to fulfill his oath to the heavenly city...",
