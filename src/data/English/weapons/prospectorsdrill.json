	"story": "A handy tool that can drill into the ground and rocks with ease.\nIt had a wide range of uses in prospecting and other operations.\nEven stonemasons and construction workers utilized its characteristics,\nTo cut rocks and create preliminary shapes and structures.\n\nLike the chainsaw once popular in the workshops and docks,\nIt relied on traditional and inefficient fuel to run.\nAt that time, when controllable Pneumousia annihilation reactions had not been developed,\nThe primitive clockwork meka were hindered by suboptimal kinematics and dynamics,\nAnd were seen as nothing more than curiosities and indulgences,\nWhile manual labor remained a necessity.\n\nThe tool's long grip was a fuel storage compartment and should be treated with care.\nEven so, there were records of the drill being used in battle.\n\nThe tool's piercing and cutting power were unmatched.\nSince it could pierce through even rocks like a hot knife through butter,\nIt made quick work out of penetrating through even softer materials.\nAs society advanced, this type of tool gradually ceased to be used in public.\nAnd like some other tools, unauthorized possession of it also became prohibited by administrative order.",
