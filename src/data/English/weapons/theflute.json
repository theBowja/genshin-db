	"story": "A nimble sword with holes and delicate engravings on the blade.\nThe sword once made the sound of a flute when wielded by one with the requisite skill. The pitch and tone were determined by the swinging angle.\nThis sword was buried when the Wanderer's Troupe disbanded. Unearthed years later, it has long since lost its ability to sing.\nEven so, it still makes a lethal weapon.\n\nAmong the members of the Wanderer's Troupe was a valiant sword-wielding dancer.\nAfter the Troupe's attempt to tear down the ruling class failed, she was enslaved as a gladiator.\n\nThough all her hope and all her companions were lost, still she fought bravely.\nHer sword sang with the radiance of the morn's light, and she was dubbed the \"Dawnlight Swordswoman.\"\n\nIn his youth, the Dawn Knight Ragnvindr was in the retinue of a knight.\nHe went with his master to watch a gladiator match, and was moved by the Dawnlight Swordswoman's splendid finale.\nHe named himself the Dawn Knight in her honor, and knew in his heart what he must do next.",
