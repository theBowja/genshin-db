It can only be a sword.\nIf nothing else, it shall bear the memory of those who faced their ends without fear...\n\nWhen you wield this sword, you search for the answers hidden within this world.\nIn this world, such a weapon may be used without any problem.\nNot for the fact that the universe casts no shadows here, and certainly not simply because it suits this world's aesthetics...\nBut because this search is perhaps why you descended to this realm in the first place.\n\nWhen the past is dust, and the future arrives,\nAs the present fades away, you can trust to this blade's edge.\nHaving a weapon for self-defense is, of course, a good idea. After all, this one was forged for one such as yourself.\nSomeone who challenges and pursues.\nTake it, walk this earth,\n\nAnd cut open all the challenges and mysteries that it has to offer you.",
