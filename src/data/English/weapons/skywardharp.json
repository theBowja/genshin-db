	"story": "The sky-piercing lyre.\nThe clear tunes of this lyre still echo in the hearts of the people and in the winds.\nIt is said that the ancient evil dragon from the abyss was enticed here by its tunes.\n\nIn ancient times, Barbatos softly strummed his lyre and summoned the pure thousand winds and songs.\nCharmed by the free-spirited winds and songs, Dvalin the high dragon descended and swore loyalty to him.\nBarbatos rejoiced in making a new friend, and entrusted the people of Mondstadt to Dvalin.\nAnd so, the wandering Anemo Archon and the Wind Dragon forged Mondstadt's dawn with their friendship.\n\nThe flowing tunes of the lyre halted the shadow dragon's attack in the final battle,\nGranting Dvalin the chance to end the shadow dragon's poisonous reign.\n\nEons after the winds sang and the vicious battle ended, Dvalin awoke from his long slumber.\nBut gone was his master, and instead he was met by the poisonous whispers of the Abyss Order.\nUnseen pain. Unheard torture.\nAn all-engulfing sorrow crushed the poisoned Dvalin's spirit.\n\nDvalin turned on what he had vowed to protect,\nAnd accused the one to whom he had sworn loyalty:\n\"Indifferent is Barbatos to my pain! A careless friend is he!\"\n\"Curse you, Barbatos, cruelest of the Archons!\"\n\nThe furious friend knew not that Barbatos sought to save him.\nFor many fond memories may have been quashed by Dvalin's anguish, but not that of Barbatos' lyre. The Holy Lyre der Himmel.\nSoon, centuries of misunderstanding shall be gone.\nSoon, Dvalin shall hear once more his songs.",
