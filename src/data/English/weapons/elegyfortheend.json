	"story": "\"The west wind bears wine's fragrance away,\"\n\"The mountain wind brings glad tidings new.\"\n\"The breeze from afar tugs at my heart,\"\n\"It sings of my longing for you.\"\n\nLong ago, there was a knight who was ever dour of countenance.\nOnly a certain song could ever cause his brow to unfurl,\nAnd only a certain girl who sang that song in the square,\nCould cause him to forget the great burden of his duty for a time.\n\nBut at last, calamity came upon this land.\nThe songs that had once flown joyfully in the wind were drowned by a venomous dragon.\nIn the wake of its earth-shaking footsteps, even the cries and the flames were ripped asunder.\nThe Anemo Archon heard their agony, though he had refused to rule.\nBut to protect his old friends' dream, and defend the wind-kissed fields of green,\nHe woke from his long slumber anew, and with the sky dragon into battle he flew...\nThe Knight and his knights also fought for their land.\n\nWhen the venomous dragon fell to ruin on the ice-sealed peak, the blue sky dragon fell asleep in the ancient tower.\nBut the Knight was in the valley, spent of his life's blood, and as he fell, he could only think thus:\n\"She is abroad studying, so she should be well. But ah, how I wish to hear her sing again.\"\n\"At least Arundolyn and Roland are alright. When she returns, this calamity should have blown over.\"\n\nThe songs in praise of the archon and tunes that recorded the battle of the two dragons were many, but all slowly became lost.\nThe song the girl loved to sing, too, changed upon her return.\n\"The dandelions carry in the summer wind,\"\n\"Autumn brings the fragrance of grain.\"\n\"But no wind in any season on earth\"\n\"Shall have you gaze upon me again.\"\n\nAnd after her voice and her tears had run dry, the girl swore to use her life's flame to cleanse the world's crookedness.",
