This must be the feeling of justice getting its dues.\"\n\"As long as I cut, slash, and pierce the evil in this twisted world,\"\n\"Someday, someday, it shall all be cleansed.\"\n\n\"O, foolish knight, slaughter in the name of justice is slaughter still.\"\n\"Nay. Slaughter in the name of justice is justice.\"\n\nCut. Slash. Pierce. Thus will you see justice done!\nThough the white flowers the maidens offer you should be bloodied black, though your sword should no longer gleam bright,\nThough your fair countenance should turn hideous, and you should be forced to don an iron mask,\nThough those you defend cannot understand you, cease never!\n\nAnd so, the black-stained knight persisted on his path, pursuing monsters in the name of justice,\nUntil he came upon an ancient, ruined realm, where he discovered the ultimate injustice...",
