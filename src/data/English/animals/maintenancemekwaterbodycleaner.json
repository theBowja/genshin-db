	"description": "Compact assistance meka developed to increase the overall utilization rates of meka teams, providing aid for underwater projects. They were originally designed to remove junk, vegetation, and other underwater debris in order to prevent these from clogging up the vital parts of other clockwork meka, thereby minimizing failure rates. From another point of view, they are undoubtedly benefiting Fontaine's ecosystem greatly as underwater cleaners.\nEquipped with high-sensitivity sensors, the meka can efficiently \"nose out\" target items through smells as well as detect the optical characteristics of underwater junk. As a result, they can be attracted by certain types of bait and are occasionally caught by anglers, who refer to them as \"Water Maintenance Fish\" or \"Iron Fish.\"\nCompared to the mass-deployed \"Initial Configuration\" model, the \"Water Body Cleaner\" model is more mature and coated with erosion-resistant material. The researchers responsible for this project introduced periodic callback and maintenance instead of just leaving them on their own after release. They would send out homing signals through flashing of a certain frequency in order to retrieve the meka, which they would then release again following maintenance and examination. Over time, certain individuals began to use this flashing method as a type of \"bait\" to catch these meka, and it is now widely known among the angling community.",
