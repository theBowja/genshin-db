	"description": "Humanity's best friend!\nBearing a fur of ashen grey, this type of dog is the closest to humans among the midlander hunting breeds. They possess prodigious stamina, allowing them to stay active for long periods in the wilderness.\nIt's only a pity that their beautiful fur cannot endure being dirtied. Owners of this breed often spend vast amounts of time bathing them.",
