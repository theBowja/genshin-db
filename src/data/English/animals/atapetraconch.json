	"description": "A conch that resembles a helmet. According to research from the Sumeru Akademiya's Amurta Darshan, this sort of conch may be one of the oldest living creatures in Teyvat, hence the name, the Atapetra Conch.\nOf course, these conch shells are like multi-purpose treasures to the children of Nod-Krai. Some collect ones with unique patterns, some wear them like helmets worn by soldiers in training, and others bring them up to their ears to hear the sound of the sea... Either way, there's no toy quite like this one!",
