	"description": "One of the most energetic residents in Teyvat, boars are found active throughout the wild.\nThis wild animal is characterized by rapid reproduction and a stubborn personality. Able to survive in various conditions, it can be encountered in all sorts of forests and wild terrain. Forest Boar meat is tasty and chewy, making it a prime ingredient for many dishes. In addition, Forest Boars are even central characters in many legends told across Teyvat.\nThe Musk family ecologists have observed some hilichurl tribes attempting to domesticate Forest Boars, presumably hoping to train them as riding animals.",
