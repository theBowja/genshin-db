	"description": "The Sangacorexes' migratory patterns resemble those of butterflies.\nWhen they have almost converted the rampaging elemental energies in a certain area, the bone structure of the next generation of Sangacorex will condense into wings of a sort. They will then fly through Enkanomiya, searching for a new place to live, grow, and multiply.\nThey were once destroyers of the old order, only capable of living while concealed in the Dark Sea. And there they would have stayed, had the serpent god not given them another opportunity.",
