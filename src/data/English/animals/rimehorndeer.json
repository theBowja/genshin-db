	"description": "A large but gentle animal with eyes that seem to perceive all things.\nThere was once a poet who, upon seeing a Rimehorn Deer, left these words to posterity: \"Its form is a silent shadow left to us as if by ancient gods. Its fur, no mortal hide, but woven as a veil about it by the moon...\"\nThe Frostmoon Scions believe that Rimehorn Deer have intelligence, that they can guide lost people and heal wounds. As such, they do not hunt or disturb them. It is said that if the one who approaches them has a good heart, they will quietly and briefly cast their gaze upon the oncomer, as though honoring some sort of ancient agreement.",
