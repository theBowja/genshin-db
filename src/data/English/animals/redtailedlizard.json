	"description": "A small lizard with horns on its head that can often be found in shadowy bushes.\nThese lizards have lovely red, patterned tails that blend in with their surroundings. They discard these tails in moments of peril to confuse their foes.\nLizard tails have special medicinal properties when dried and ground down into a powder. Some crazy alchemists have even found a way to process them into catalysts for explosions.\nOnce they are separated from the body, these tails will lose their vitality and curl up.",
