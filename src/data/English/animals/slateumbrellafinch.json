	"name": "Slate Umbrellafinch",
	"description": "A small, round bird that is a distant relative to Fontainian Finches. The name Umbrellafinch comes from the mushroom-parasol like, unique-looking feathered crest they possess.\nResearch suggests that Slate Umbrellafinches have exceptional abilities dissonant from their appearance, and they are capable of hovering for long periods of time. Additionally, their slate-colored feathers are also a type of camouflage, allowing them to blend into backdrops of sea and sky to effectively evade the detection of their predators.",
