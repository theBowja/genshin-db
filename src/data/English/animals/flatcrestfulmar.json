	"description": "A large sea bird that dwells in Fontaine. This bird earned the name Flatcrest Fulmar for its straight and white feathered crest.\nAs a kind of bird that preys on fish, the Flatcrest Fulmar is extremely adept at tracking shoals of fish. Therefore, as some documents describe, seasoned fishers will not drive away the Flatcrest Fulmars that hunt near their ships, choosing instead to coexist with them.",
