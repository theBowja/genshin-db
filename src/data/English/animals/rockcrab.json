	"description": "A crab that lives within shells and conches. A distant relation to the Fontainian Armored Crab.\nMore docile than its Fontemer relatives, it does not seem to have any aggressive tendencies. Having long made their homes in environments suffused with kuuvahki, they have evolved the ability to use small amounts of kuuvahki to find shells for themselves to live in. Perhaps this way, though they live on the frigid tundra, they can still feel the warmth of home at any and all times.",
