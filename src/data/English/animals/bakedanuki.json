	"description": "A carefree tanuki that comes and goes without leaving any trace, and that knows mystical arts passed down only amongst their kindred. It has the ability to transform into other objects, including humans.\nAlthough they often tangle with a mysterious organization under the Shogunate, the tanuki are not a wicked lot and only tease humans for fun.\nThere is but one recorded exception: years ago, the bake-danuki who guarded Chinju Forest started a battle due to some conflict between their leader Ioroi and a kitsune. In the end, most of the bake-danuki were sealed within stone statues.",
