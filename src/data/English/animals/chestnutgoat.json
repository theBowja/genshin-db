	"description": "This goat appears no different from any other that lives in Teyvat â€” apart from its glowing markings and horns.\nSo named for its soft, long chestnut-colored coat, it has two layers of hair, with the outer layer being long and waterproof, while the inner, milk-white layer is soft and fluffy, making it an ideal material for winter wear and woolen blankets.\nLong exposure to high-intensity kuuvahki environments has caused both its horns and the markings on its body to glow faintly.",
