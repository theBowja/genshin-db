	"description": "Medium-sized fish with a flat body and a gentle temperament, Greenwave Sunfish are considered to be one of the least irritable creatures in the waters of Natlan. Capable of consuming almost anything, their utterly indiscriminate eating habits make them natural cleaners of the underwater world, a trait that has earned them high praise among locals.\nIn some folk tales, the intertwining colors with which the skins of these Sunfish are adorned, with their bright reds and light blues, are said to be the result of them having \"drunk the remnants of the sunset.\" Both sunlight and firelight are cherished and revered by the people of Natlan, and as such, writers from Liyue and Fontaine have seen this story as epitomizing the \"unique romance of Natlan.\"",
