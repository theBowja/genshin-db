	"name": "Leisurely Otter",
	"description": "A unique lifeform that lives in the water. Rumor has it that this creature has a deep phylogenetic relationship with the weasels that can be seen quite commonly on land. Its temperament is meek and indolent, and the rhythm of its existence is unhurried, bearing no sense of stress within its being.\nWhen people encounter these languid otters, they often find these creatures floating with their backs facing the water, bringing both their paws together as a gesture of greeting. However, beneath their leisurely facade, they also possess a cleverness in their living, bearing enough intellect to use reefs to open up shellfish or mollusks in hopes of extracting delicious sustenance. Sometimes, after finding themselves stuffed from a massive meal, they won't need to forage for quite some time, allowing them to condense their eating habits into something best described as \"stuff yourself lots now and rest lots more later.\"",
