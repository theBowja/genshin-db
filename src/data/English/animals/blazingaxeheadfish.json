	"name": "Blazing Axehead Fish",
	"description": "A fish with unique morphology and family ties to the Axe Marlins. Some biologists have theorized that the species split when the Axe Marlins took an evolutionary gamble on axe-shaped bellies, while the Axehead Fishes doubled down on axe-shaped skulls.\nThis rare variant, marked by a vivid, searing red spine — like a branding iron — is an uncommon sight in the waters of Nod-Krai. Local legends tell of a time when those who dared provoke nature's ire drifted on boats across these waters, only for this fish to silently appear and slice through their hulls with its blazing-hot back, sending the wrongdoers to a watery grave. Out of respect (and perhaps a touch of superstition), lucky anglers who manage to reel in a Blazing Axehead often release it back into the wild, or house it reverently in an ornate aquarium.",
