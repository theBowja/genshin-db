	"description": "To most animals, Frostfin Whales are fierce predators... but not to humans.\nTheir giant tail fins could easily sink a fishing boat, and they could swallow a human whole, but any old fisherfolk worth their sea salt knows that no Frostfin Whale has ever actively attacked a human. Instead, they love to race against ships and often leap from the water, as if enjoying playing with humanity.\nIt is said that some busybodies have waited as long as several hours, trembling out in the cold, just to catch a glimpse of one making such a leap. How could anyone refuse when a creature of such power and beauty were to reveal its smile only to you?",
