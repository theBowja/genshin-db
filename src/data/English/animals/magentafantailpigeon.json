	"name": "Magenta Fantail Pigeon",
	"description": "The Magenta Fantail Pigeon are close relatives of Pigeons. They are graceful in appearance, and though they can be used to send messages after being trained, few people use them as messengers.\nThis type of bird possesses carmine feathers and a fan-shaped tail. The shape of their tail feathers strikingly resembles a red-colored heart, which thus caused them to be regarded as heralds of love by poets. In actuality, the bird's red patterns and crimson tail are used to scare off their natural enemies, and have nothing to do with matters of courtship.",
