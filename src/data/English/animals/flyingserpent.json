	"description": "A reptile with a limited ability to hover.\nFlying serpents do not truly possess the ability to fly; their ability to hover seems to derive from their bird-like hollow bones and the sparkle of Anemo that imbues them with a subtle influence over the wind. The desert is a far way from the nation of Anemo, but its lands are still ever-graced by gales intent on eroding everything. Everything, from cities to history, will eventually be razed to sand grains by the winnowing currents that drift over the Great Red Sand. Only creatures such as the flying serpents, which have learned to live with the wind, can continue to survive in the desert long after all has been reduced to dust.",
