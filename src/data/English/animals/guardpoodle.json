Parts of their body are guarded by metallic protections, granting them a bearing akin to soldiers. To most of your typical animals or even the common bandit, this dog is as intimidating as a human bodyguard. As such, some rich merchants have taken a special interest in owning this breed of pet, adding both novelty and security to their lives.",
