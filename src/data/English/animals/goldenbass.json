	"description": "A type of fish commonly found in bodies of water everywhere. Their meat is sumptuous, making them an important resource for fish-related gourmet dishes in Teyvat.\nGolden Basses are a much less common sight than Black-Back or Blue-Fin variants. It is said that such fish can bring the one who catches them good luck.\nThere were once those who peddled protective talismans and blessing cards made in the image of Golden Basses in the city streets of Liyue Harbor. It was also a common saying in Inazuma that the golden setting sun was like a Golden Bass swimming across the skies.",
