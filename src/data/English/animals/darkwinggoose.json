	"name": "Darkwing Goose",
	"description": "A large bird that lives in ponds or lakes. A close relative of Snow-Wing Geese.\nDue to the Darkwing Geese bearing wings of pitch black, they were once thought of as Snow-Wing Geese that have been cursed. Due to such superstitions, the Darkwing Geese were regarded by a minority of Fontainians as omens of abnormality and uncertain calamities.\nWith the changing of the times, people began to seek new and fresher expressions of art. Hence, there came an increased number of works portraying the Darkwing Geese in a more positive light. In Fontaine's artistic circles, the term \"Darkwing Goose\" has been used to describe unexpected phenomena and individuals who were ill-regarded at the inception, but proved to astonish with the passing of time.",
