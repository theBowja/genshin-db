	"name": "Pale-Furred Wolf",
	"description": "Hunters of the wild plains and forests, as solemn and noble as the frozen tundra of the North.\nUnlike most other beasts, they value the advantages of living in a pack over solitary strength. They rarely initiate attacks, even when humans trespass on their territory. Instead, they first issue extended howls as an ominous caution to the strayed.\nLegend has it that the wolves seldom engage with humans due to the ancient rules decreed by their Wolf King, and consequently, records and research concerning them remain scarce. Yet, judging from the folk tales passed down across Teyvat, these wolves are believed to be rather tame creatures.\nIn even older stories, the wolves that roam the land are descendants of the Northwind, guided across the wilderness by the Wolf King, a being once equal in stature to the gods of this world. Though the Wolf King has long passed on, its descendants — the wolves of today — continue their silent watch through the cold night, until the pale morning star rises once more.",
