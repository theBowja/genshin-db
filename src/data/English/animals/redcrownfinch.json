	"description": "A small songbird commonly found in Fontaine that sings pleasant melodies.\nHowever, despite their good-natured and adorable facade, the Redcrown Finches are extremely combative, sometimes actively and rashly attacking other birds in their vicinity. But while young and bare of feathers upon their crest, these birds are confused and ignorant, hollow of any bellicosity.\nAs such, in folklore, the feathered crests of the Redcrown Finches are a sign of courage, for only finches that have grown the feathers upon their crest can be seen as warriors that \"dare to defy fate itself.\"",
