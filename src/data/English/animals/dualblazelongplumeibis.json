	"description": "A majestic bird with slender wings.\nThe Dualblaze Longplume Ibis does not submerge itself to capture fish like most waterfowl. Rather, it prefers to hover in the air for long periods of time before locking onto its target and diving down, seizing its prey in one highly agile move.\nThey have large throat pouches that can emit a two-colored glow, hence the name \"Dualblaze Longplume Ibis.\" This pouch was originally meant to help store food over long distances, but during courtship season, it becomes a tool with which to secure bragging rights and jockey for dominance â€” laying aside their majesty, they puff up these sacs to compare brightness, color, and size.\nIt seems humans are not the only species that care about whether their spouses have fat wallets.",
