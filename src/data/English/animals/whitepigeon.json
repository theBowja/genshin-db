	"name": "White Pigeon",
	"description": "A common avian species in Teyvat. Plump and meaty, but also capable of delivering messages.\nThis pure-white member of the pigeon family is especially friendly towards humans, but is also highly perceptive of humans' ill intent. Interesting trivia: There is a widely held belief in Mondstadt that an authentic Sweet Madame must be cooked using pigeon meat, but this is just a rumor and nothing more.",
