Attached to the Knights of Favonius as an assistant to Albedo, her area of focus is 'bio-alchemy.' She strives to enrich the world by transforming living things with the power of alchemy. Granted, the products of her research sometimes prove to be more weird than wonderful — but on the whole, she has made monumental contributions to the field of bio-alchemy.",
